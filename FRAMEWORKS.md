## ICE Framework (Impact, Confidence, Ease)

The **ICE Framework** is a scoring methodology that helps prioritize tasks based on three key dimensions:

### Components

- **Impact (I)**: How much will this task move the needle? (1-10 scale)
- **Confidence (C)**: How confident are you in your estimates? (1-10 scale)  
- **Ease (E)**: How easy is this task to implement? (1-10 scale)

### Calculation

```
ICE Score = (Impact × Confidence × Ease) / 100
```

### Usage Guidelines

| Score Range | Priority Level | Action |
|-------------|----------------|---------|
| 8.0 - 10.0  | High Priority | Do First |
| 6.0 - 7.9   | Medium Priority | Schedule Soon |
| 4.0 - 5.9   | Low Priority | Consider Later |
| < 4.0       | Very Low | Defer or Delete |

### Example

**Task**: Implement user authentication
- **Impact**: 9 (Critical for user security)
- **Confidence**: 8 (Well-understood requirement)
- **Ease**: 6 (Moderate complexity)
- **ICE Score**: (9 × 8 × 6) / 100 = 4.32

## 4D Decision Framework

The **4D Framework** categorizes tasks into four decision types to clarify action steps:

### The Four Ds

#### 1. **DO** 🎯
- **When**: High impact, urgent, within your skillset
- **Action**: Execute immediately or schedule for priority time
- **Characteristics**: Important work that moves you toward goals

#### 2. **DELEGATE** 👥
- **When**: Important but others can do it better/faster
- **Action**: Assign to appropriate team member with clear expectations
- **Characteristics**: Tasks that develop others or free up your time for higher-value work

#### 3. **DELAY** ⏰
- **When**: Important but not urgent
- **Action**: Schedule for later with specific date/time
- **Characteristics**: Strategic work, planning, skill development

#### 4. **DELETE** 🗑️
- **When**: Low impact, unnecessary, or outdated
- **Action**: Remove from task list entirely
- **Characteristics**: Busy work, outdated requirements, perfectionism tasks

### Decision Matrix

| Urgency/Impact | High Impact | Low Impact |
|----------------|-------------|------------|
| **High Urgency** | DO | DO (if quick) or DELETE |
| **Low Urgency** | DELAY | DELETE |

## Eisenhower Matrix

The **Eisenhower Matrix** (also known as the Urgent-Important Matrix) categorizes tasks into four quadrants:

### Quadrants

| | **Urgent** | **Not Urgent** |
|--|------------|-----------------|
| **Important** | **Q1: DO** <br>Crisis, emergencies, deadline-driven projects | **Q2: SCHEDULE** <br>Prevention, planning, development, recreation |
| **Not Important** | **Q3: DELEGATE** <br>Interruptions, some calls/emails, some meetings | **Q4: ELIMINATE** <br>Time wasters, excessive social media, irrelevant activities |

### Quadrant Focus Strategy

- **Quadrant 1 (Urgent + Important)**: Handle immediately
- **Quadrant 2 (Important + Not Urgent)**: Schedule and protect time
- **Quadrant 3 (Urgent + Not Important)**: Delegate or minimize
- **Quadrant 4 (Not Urgent + Not Important)**: Eliminate

## MoSCoW Method

**MoSCoW** is a prioritization technique used in project management:

### Categories

#### Must Have (Mo) 🔴
- **Criteria**: Critical requirements without which the project fails
- **Action**: Deliver in current iteration/sprint
- **Examples**: Core functionality, legal compliance, security basics

#### Should Have (S) 🟡
- **Criteria**: Important but not critical; has workarounds
- **Action**: Include if time and resources permit
- **Examples**: Performance improvements, user experience enhancements

#### Could Have (Co) 🟢
- **Criteria**: Nice to have; adds value but not essential
- **Action**: Consider for future releases
- **Examples**: Additional features, convenience improvements

#### Won't Have (W) ⚪
- **Criteria**: Agreed not to include in current scope
- **Action**: Document for potential future consideration
- **Examples**: Out-of-scope features, future enhancement ideas

## RICE Framework

**RICE** extends the ICE framework by adding a Reach component:

### Components

- **Reach (R)**: How many people will be affected? (number of users/month)
- **Impact (I)**: How much impact per person? (0.25, 0.5, 1, 2, 3)
- **Confidence (C)**: How confident are you? (percentage)
- **Effort (E)**: How much work will this take? (person-months)

### Calculation

```
RICE Score = (Reach × Impact × Confidence) / Effort
```

### Impact Scale

| Score | Description | Example |
|-------|-------------|---------|
| 3 | Massive impact | Core feature that transforms user experience |
| 2 | High impact | Significant improvement to key workflow |
| 1 | Medium impact | Notable improvement to user experience |
| 0.5 | Low impact | Minor improvement |
| 0.25 | Minimal impact | Barely noticeable improvement |
